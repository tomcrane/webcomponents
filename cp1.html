    <p>Version 1 | <a href="cp2.html">Version 2</a></p>

    <p>In this type of usage, CP is entirely declarative. It needs to go off and load things uder the hood.
        In this case it will need to load the manifest, then find the canvas in it, then

        To be useful for people who want to do this, CP needs to have all the normalisation to P3 built in.

        The crucial thing is, I don't know what's on this canvas.
        I don't even know if it has an image, image with tilesource, multiple images, Choice,
        Audio, Video, text.

        As my viewer gets more sophisticated, I might want to deal with more stuff.
        But do I work out what the stuff is, outside of CP?

        Or do I react to what CP finds on the canvas?

    <div is="canvas-panel-1" id="cp1" class="canvaspanel" 
        data-canvas-uri="https://wellcomelibrary.org/iiif/b18035723/canvas/c8"
        data-partof-uri="https://tomcrane.github.io/webcomponents/wunder.json">
    </div>

    <p>I haven't written any code here to respond to anything on that canvas that might need
        a user interaction...
        Like Choice. Or a hyperlinking annotation... what should that do?

        Bubble up.
